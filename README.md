# biodivmonit

The data and code for analysing biodiversity monitoring data using Hidden Markov Models.

Repository for data and code to reproduce Hidden Markov model analyses for this work.

Data folder includes .rda data for bird species detections and final data for the analysis.  Data structure is described in the corresponding README file for the data..

R folder contains R script for aggregating the bird species detection data, preparing the final data for analysis bird species detections, and analysing the data using HMMs.

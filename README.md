Repository for data and code to reproduce Hidden Markov model analyses for this work.

Data folder includes .rda data for bird species detections and final data for the analysis.  Data structure is described in the corresponding README file for the data.

Code folder contains R script (HMM analysis.R) for analysing the data using the HMM framework in the paper. The code for running three state standard, mean constrained (3C) and mean constrained model with precipitation (3C_P) is included.
